                    <p>Not much to say about my art journey. I honestly feel like I haven't really explored enough art to really call myself an "artist";
                        Imposter Syndrome maybe? Art was just something I happened to be doing since I was young and just also so happened to stick with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Anyway to keep it short and sweet, I do enjoy art but to say I'm passionate may be an overstatement.</p>
                    <p>My favorite mediums are probably oil pastels and graphite, although I do sometimes hate the shine graphite gives. I would love to do
                        gouache but the prices on those sets are crazy lol. I also enjoy most 3D mediums. I might have a preference for them too, but it's
                        just more convenient to stick to 2D art. I don't really have any plans to improve and I'm just going with the flow for when I want
                        to do art. It's tricky to do that while trying to balance with school and work anyway. 
                    </p>
                    <p>So yeah, welcome to my art archive. This is just a nice place to dump and organize all my art works while also doing a coding project.
                        Thanks for taking a look, I hope you find something that catches your eye :)</p>
